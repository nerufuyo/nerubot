# Commit Format
This document outlines the recommended format for commit messages in this project. Following a consistent commit message format helps maintain clarity and improves collaboration among team members.

feat: Add a new feature or functionality
fix: Resolve a bug or issue
docs: Update documentation or comments
style: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.) that do not affect functionality
refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
test: Add or update tests
chore: Routine tasks such as build process changes, package updates, etc.   

- Avoid Emojis: While emojis can be fun, they may not render correctly in all environments and can lead to confusion.
- Use the Imperative Mood: Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Keep it Concise: Aim for a short summary in the subject line (50 characters or less) and provide additional details in the body if necessary.
