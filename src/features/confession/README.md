# Anonymous Confession System

## Overview

The Anonymous Confession System allows users to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences completely anonymously in your Discord server. The system is designed to maintain complete anonymity while providing an organized and interactive environment for confessions and replies.

## Features

### üîí Complete Anonymity
- All messages are posted by the bot, not the user
- No usernames, avatars, or user IDs are visible
- No way to trace messages back to original authors
- Consistent anonymous formatting throughout

### üÜî Unique ID System
- **Confessions**: Sequential numbering (CONF-001, CONF-002, etc.)
- **Replies**: Parent ID + letter suffix (REPLY-001-A, REPLY-001-B, etc.)
- Easy reference system for users to reply to specific messages

### üìù Modal-Based Interface
- **New Confession Modal**: 2 fields (message, attachments)
- **Reply Modal**: 3 fields (message, confession_id, attachments)
- Clean, intuitive user interface

### üßµ Thread Organization
- Each confession automatically creates a thread
- All replies are posted in the thread for better organization
- Threads auto-archive after 7 days

### üìé Attachment Support
- Support for images, GIFs, and videos
- Multiple attachments per confession/reply
- URL-based attachment system

```

This will:

- Add a persistent "Create New Confession" button

### 2. Introduction Message
The bot will post an introduction message in the channel explaining:
- How the system works
- Features available

- Sequential ID generation for confessions
- Letter-based ID generation for replies
- Data persistence via JSON files

### Views
- `SetupView`: Initial setup button
- `ConfessionView`: Main interaction buttons
- Persistent views for reliability

## Data Structure

### Confession IDs
- Start from 1 for each guild
- Format: `CONF-{ID:03d}` (e.g., CONF-001)
- Sequential numbering per guild

### Reply IDs
- Format: `REPLY-{confession_id:03d}-{letter}` (e.g., REPLY-001-A)
- Letters increment per confession (A, B, C, etc.)
- Hierarchical organization

### File Storage
- `confessions.json`: All confession data
- `replies.json`: All reply data
- `settings.json`: Guild settings and ID counters

## Security & Privacy

### Anonymity Protection

- All messages posted by bot account
- No correlation between messages and users
- Consistent formatting for all messages

### Moderation
- Currently auto-approves all confessions
- Framework exists for future moderation features
- Cooldown system prevents spam

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Buttons not working**: Views are persistent but may need bot restart
2. **Threads not creating**: Check bot permissions for thread creation
3. **Attachments not showing**: Ensure URLs are valid and accessible

### Required Permissions

- Create Threads
- Upload Files
- Use Slash Commands
- Add Reactions/Buttons
