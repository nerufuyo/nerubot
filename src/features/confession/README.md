## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Server Administrators

   ```

2. **View current settings:**
   ```
   /confession-settings
   ```

3. **Check statistics:**
   ```

   ```

### For Users

1. **Submit a confession:**
   ```
   /confess [image: optional_image.png]
   ```
   This opens a modal where you can type your anonymous confession. Images are optional.

2. **Reply to a confession:**

   ```
   Replace `abc12345` with the confession ID you want to reply to. Images are optional.
